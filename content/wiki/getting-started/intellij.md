**IntelliJ IDEA** is a special programming environment or **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE) largely meant for **Java**. This environment is used especially for the development of programs. It is developed by a company called **JetBrains**, which was formally called **IntelliJ**. It is available in two editions: the Community Edition which is licensed by Apache 2.0, and a commercial edition known as the Ultimate Edition. Both of them can be used for creating software which can be sold. What makes **IntelliJ IDEA** so different from its counterparts is its ease of use, flexibility and its solid design.
