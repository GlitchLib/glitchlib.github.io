# Before Starting

Before start we need a download some tools to using our IDE.

### Download

Install it and configure environmental variables: `JAVA_HOME` if not exist, create and adding to `PATH` - `$JAVA_HOME/bin`.

- [JDK8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
- [JDK10](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html).
- [JDK11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html).

#### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

**Eclipse** is an open-source platform of extensible software development application frameworks, tools and run times that was initially created as a _Java-based **Integrated Development Environment**_ (IDE). 

Eclipse's runtime system is based on a collection of **Equinox Open Services Gateway Initiative** (OSGi) runtime-built open-source projects covering **Java IDE**, **static/dynamic languages**, **thick/thin-client** and **server-side frameworks**, **modeling/business reporting** and **embedded/mobile systems**.
